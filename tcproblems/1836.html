crime, where the crime was committed, and with what weapon.  In this problem, we will number the suspects 1-6, the 
weapons 1-6, and the locations 1-9 and assume that there are exactly 3 people playing. Each suspect, weapon 
and location is represented by its own card, for a total of 21 cards.  In the game, one suspect card, one weapon 
card and one location card are secretly chosen at random and set aside as the suspect, weapon and location associated 
with the crime.  The remaining cards are then dealt so that each player gets a total of exactly 6 cards.  There are a number of turns in a game, and each turn a player guesses one suspect, one weapon and one location.  Then the player to his left examines her cards, and if she has one or more of the cards in 
the guess, she must reveal one of them to the player who made the guess.  If she has more than one of the cards, she gets to choose which one to reveal.  If, and only if, the player to the immediate left of the guesser doesn't have one of the three cards, then the third player (to the guesser's right) must examine his or her cards, and perform the same procedure.  Eventually, enough guesses are made that one player may deduce which cards are set aside, and he or she wins the game.<br><br>

Your goal is to write a class to try to deduce the cards which are set aside.  You will be given a 
String[], <b>cards</b>, representing the cards in your hand.  You will also be given a 
String[], <b>guesses</b>, representing the guesses made, in the order they were made, and the results of 
the guesses.  Each element of <b>cards</b> will be formatted as &quot;&lt;type&gt;&lt;number&gt;&quot;, where &lt;type&gt; is 
'S', 'L', or 'W', representing suspect, location or weapon, respectively.  &lt;number&gt; is a single digit, 
representing which suspect, location or weapon the card shows.  Each element of <b>guesses</b> will be formatted 
as:
<br><br>&quot;&lt;guesser&gt; &lt;suspect guessed&gt; &lt;location guessed&gt; &lt;weapon guessed&gt;  &lt;responder&gt; 
&lt;response&gt;&quot;<br><br>  
&lt;guesser&gt; will be a digit between 1 and 3, inclusive, representing the person making 
the guess.  You are player 1, so if &lt;guesser&gt; is 1, it means that you made the guess.  &lt;suspect guessed&gt;, 
&lt;location guessed&gt;, and &lt;weapon guessed&gt; will all be single digits representing which suspect, location 
and weapon were guessed.  &lt;responder&gt; will be a single digit between 0 and 3, inclusive, representing the player who responded to the guess.  &lt;responder&gt; will not be the 
same as &lt;guesser&gt;.  If &lt;responder&gt; is 0, it means that none of the non-guessing players had any of the 
cards associated with the guess.  If &lt;responder&gt; is 1, it means that you are the one who 
responded, and &lt;response&gt; will be an element of <b>cards</b>, representing which card you showed to 
the guesser.  If &lt;guesser&gt; is 1, then you are the one who guessed, and if &lt;responder&gt; is not 0, then &lt;response&gt; will represent the card that player &lt;responder&gt; showed you.  If you are the guesser and no one responded, or if you are neither the responder nor the guesser, then &lt;response&gt; will be &quot;N0&quot; (the number zero, not the letter oh), meaning that the response was either hidden from you or did not exist.
<br><br>
You are to determine the set of cards that could be secret cards.  This set will always contain at least one suspect, one location, and one weapon.  You should return a sorted String[], each of whose elements represents a single card in this set, in the same format as elements of <b>cards</b>.
