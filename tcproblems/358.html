For every problem given on TopCoder, there are restrictions on the input that
TopCoder checks.  For the most simple inputs, this could be as easy as ensuring
that a single int is between 1 and 50, inclusive.  On more complicated
problems, this CheckData() method (as it is called) becomes more difficult.

Implement a class Checker with a method CheckData() that will take a String[]
as an argument.  You must ensure that the String[] is a valid input for the
following &quot;problem description&quot;:

****** BEGIN PSUEDO-PROBLEM DESCRIPTION ******
You are given a String[] lovers representing a love triangle.  Each element in
this String[] will be formatted as follows:
&quot;NAME1 LOVES NAME2&quot;
(quotes added for clarity only).

Checker will ensure the following:
*lovers will contain between 2 and 20 elements, inclusive.
*Each element of lovers will contain less than or equal to 40 characters and
will be formatted as
 &quot;NAME1 LOVES NAME2&quot; (quotes added for clarity again)
with the capital word LOVES and only one space between words, and no leading
or trailing spaces.
*NAME1 and NAME2 will be names of non-zero length.
*NAME1 and NAME2 will not be identical (everyone loves themselves anyway).
*NAME1 and NAME2 will contain only capital letters [A-Z] and/or hyphens '-'.
*For each NAME2 there will be a corresponding NAME1 in lovers.  That is,
everyone loves someone else in the problem.

Notes:
*One person may love multiple people (repeated NAME1 in different elements) and
one person may be loved by multiple people (repeated NAME2 in different
elements).
*It is possible for two elements to be identical.
 (ex {&quot;A LOVES B&quot;,&quot;A LOVES B&quot;,&quot;B LOVES A&quot;} is valid).
****** END PSUEDO-PROBLEM STATEMENT ******

DEFINITION
Class name: Checker
Method name: CheckData
Parameters: String[]
Returns: boolean
The method signature is:
boolean CheckData(String[] lovers)
Be sure your method is public.

For technical reasons, TopCoder will ensure the following:
*lovers contains 0 to 50 elements.
*each element of lovers contains 0 to 50 characters, inclusive.
*each element of lovers contains characters ([a-z][A-Z][0-9]), spaces, or any
of the characters (quotes added for clarity) &quot;&lt;&gt;./?;:{}[]=+-_|&quot;.

EXAMPLES
{&quot;D-G LOVES M&quot;,
 &quot;M LOVES D-G&quot;,
 &quot;T LOVES G&quot;,
 &quot;G LOVES D-G&quot;}
This input matches the above criteria, so CheckData returns true.

{&quot;D LOVES M&quot;,
 &quot;D LOVES C&quot;,
 &quot;G LOVES M&quot;,
 &quot;M LOVES T&quot;,
 &quot;T LOVES D&quot;}
Since C is loved but never appears as NAME1, this returns false.

{&quot;D LOVES M&quot;,
 &quot;C LOVES C&quot;,
 &quot;G LOVES M&quot;,
 &quot;M LOVES T&quot;,
 &quot;T LOVES D&quot;}
Now we see that C desperately tries loving himself, but that is not allowed so
the method returns false.

{&quot;N LOVES C&quot;,
 &quot;C LOVES D&quot;,
 &quot;D LOVES M&quot;,
 &quot;M LOVES g&quot;,
 &quot;g LOVES N&quot;}
g has lowercase letters in his name and therefore the method returns false.

{&quot;A LOVES B&quot;,
 &quot;A LOVES C&quot;,
 &quot;C LOVES A&quot;,
 &quot;B  LOVES A&quot;}
Element 3 has a badly formatted string (two spaces where only one is allowed),
so the result is false.

{&quot;ME LOVES YOU&quot;}
Since 2-20 elements (inclusive) are necessary, this returns false.

{&quot;ME LOVES YOU&quot;,
 &quot;ME LOVES YOU&quot;}
This has the correct number of elements, and the repeat is legal.  However,
since YOU never exists as NAME1, the result is still false.

{&quot;ME LOVES YOU&quot;,
 &quot;ME LOVES YOU&quot;,
 &quot;YOU LOVES ME&quot;}
The above situation remedied.  This returns true.

{&quot;I LOVE YOU&quot;,
 &quot;YOU LOVE I&quot;}
Both Strings are incorrectly formatted (LOVE instead of LOVES), so the method
returns false.
