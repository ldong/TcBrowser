The maze is rectangle-shaped and the layout of maze is in the String[] <b>maze</b>, 
where the j-th character of the i-th element is the cell at row i, column j. 
The following types of cells exist in the maze: 
<ul>
	<li>'#' - <i>Wall</i>. They cannot enter these cells. </li>
	<li>'.' - <i>Empty cell</i>. They can walk freely into these cells. </li>
	<li>'L', 'F' or 'R' - <i>Empty cell with Entrance</i>. They can walk freely into these cells. </li>
</ul>
<br>
To enter the maze, Lecette chooses a cell marked as 'L' randomly and uniformly. 
Fox does the same with a cell marked as 'F', and Rabbit does the same with a cell marked as 'R'. 
They will each warp to the chosen cell. 
Then, they decide on a meeting cell such that the total walking distance from the entrances to the meeting cell is minimized. 
When walking, they can only move in the four cardinal directions. 
They cannot move diagonally. 
The walking distance to a neighboring cell is 1. 
<br><br>
Calculate the expected total walking distance, 
and return it as a String of the form "<i>X</i>/<i>Y</i>" (quotes for clarity), 
where <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are positive integers with no common factor greater than 1. 
In case there is a non-zero probability that they cannot meet, return an empty String instead.
